A matrix is constructed of size n*n and given an integer ‘q’. The value at every cell of the matrix is given as, M(i,j) = i+j, where ‘M(i,j)' is the value of a cell, ‘i’ is the row number, and ‘j’ is the column number. Return the number of cells having value ‘q’.

Note: Assume, the array is in 1-based indexing.

Examples:

Input: n = 4, q = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Matrix becomes
2 3 4 5 
3 4 5 6 
4 5 6 7
5 6 7 8
The count of 7 is 2.

Approach simple if else condition 
condition 1;
min element =2 && max element in matrix=2*n
condition 2:
if n>=q ans would be q-1 
condition 3:
this condition is if n<q 
return n -q+n+1 == 2n-q+1

class Solution {
  public:
    long long sumMatrix(long long n, long long q) {
        // code here]
        if(q<2 || q>2*n){
            return 0;
        }
        else if(n>=q){
            return q-1;
        }
        else{
            long long temp=q-n;
            return n-(temp-1);
        }
    }
};
